# MIPS 32-bit Processor - Single Cycle Implementation

This repository contains a Verilog implementation of a 32-bit MIPS processor using a single-cycle architecture. The design aims to execute each instruction in a single clock cycle, providing a straightforward and efficient approach to understanding MIPS architecture.

## Features

- Single Cycle Execution: Each instruction is completed in one clock cycle.
- 32-bit Data Path: Supports 32-bit wide instructions and data.
- MIPS Instruction Set: Implements a subset of the MIPS instruction set.
- Modular Design: Composed of separate modules for ALU, control unit, register file, and memory.
